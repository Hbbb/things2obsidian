# things2obsidian

A command-line tool to import Today's tasks from the Things app into Obsidian.

## Overview

things2obsidian is a lightweight CLI tool that connects to your Things database, extracts tasks from the “Today” list, and formats them as Markdown task lists for easy integration into Obsidian notes. This tool is designed for users who want to seamlessly sync their tasks from Things into their daily Obsidian workflow.

## Motivation

I built things2obsidian to streamline my daily productivity workflow. As an avid user of both Things and Obsidian, I wanted a quick and easy way to transfer my “Today” tasks from Things directly into my Obsidian notes without manual copying and pasting. This tool automates the process, saving time and ensuring that my tasks are always up-to-date in Obsidian.
